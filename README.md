# smart-irrigation-system
A smart irrigation system utilizing real-time data from sensors to optimize water use, reduce waste, and enhance plant health, integrating easily with other smart technologies for sustainable water management
Introduction
The Smart Irrigation System is an IoT-based project aimed at automating the watering process for plants. 
The system uses soil moisture sensors to monitor the moisture level of the soil and activates the water pump when the soil is dry. This ensures efficient water usage and healthy plant growth..


Features
Automatic watering based on soil moisture levels
Remote monitoring and control via a web interface or mobile app
Notifications for water levels, soil moisture, and pump status
Manual override for water pump
Data logging for soil moisture levels and water usage

Components
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32, Raspberry Pi)
Soil moisture sensors
Water pump
Relay module
Wi-Fi module (if using Arduino)
Power supply
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Water container and tubing

Installation
Hardware Setup:

Connect the soil moisture sensor to the microcontroller.
Connect the water pump to the relay module, and then connect the relay module to the microcontroller.
Connect the Wi-Fi module (if required) to the microcontroller.
Power up the microcontroller and the other components.

Software Setup:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-irrigation-system.git
cd smart-irrigation-system
Install the required libraries:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Upload the code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE or the respective IDE for your microcontroller.

Usage
The system will automatically water the plants when the soil moisture level drops below the predefined threshold.
Use the web interface or mobile app to manually control the water pump, monitor soil moisture levels, and check the status of the system.

Troubleshooting
No response from the sensor:

Check the sensor connections.
Ensure the sensor is properly inserted into the soil.
Pump not working:

Check the relay connections.
Ensure the pump is receiving power.
